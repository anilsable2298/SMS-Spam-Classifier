# SMS-Spam-Classifier
## Project Objective:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately identifies SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). This project serves as an excellent introduction to text classification and Natural Language Processing(NLP).
## Conclusion:
This project is a great way for beginners to get hands-on experience with machine learning and NLP. As you grow more comfortable, you can experiment with advanced techniques like text normalization (stemming, lemmatization) and TF-IDF vectorization. The world of data science is vast and exciting, and projects like these are your first step towards mastering it.
